    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, it should be noted that a common problem within the IT field is having to deal with the number of anachronisms that exist, in fact, an old anecdote tells that the programming industry is based on `TLA` (__Three Letter Acronyms__). However, JSON breaks with this tradition, since it is an acronym for `JavaScript Object Notation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON, while intended for JavaScript use, is a universal format for transferring information that is part of an object between different systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON defines a system for representing objects that can be sent over the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does this by doing the following:\n",
    "- It uses UTF-8 to encode text.\n",
    "    - Is human readable\n",
    "    - Does not depend on a third party to read it\n",
    "- Defines a system for representing object relationships\n",
    "- In the main layers it works as a dictionary\n",
    "- Each value can be an object, an array, a number, a string, a boolean, or null.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a json:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"John\",\n",
    "  \"age\": 30,\n",
    "  \"cars\": {\n",
    "    \"car1\": \"Ford\",\n",
    "  }\n",

    "## JSON datatype\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON supports the following data types:\n",
    "- __Integers__: Are write as a number (`123`)\n",
    "  - Only numbers from base 10 are supported (no hexadecimal, octal, etc.)\n",
    "  - Negative numbers are supported by using the `-` sign\n",
    "  - Positive numbers don't need the `+` sign\n",
    "- __Real numbers__: Are written as a number with a decimal point (`123.45`)\n",
    "  - Negative numbers are supported by using the `-` sign\n",
    "  - Positive numbers don't need the `+` sign\n",
    "- __Strings__: Are written as a string (`\"Hello World\"`)\n",
    "  - Are enclosed in double quotes\n",
    "  - Can't be split across multiple lines\n",
    "  - Can contain any character, including escape characters\n",
    "    - ![Scaping characters](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "- __Boolean__: Are written as `true` or `false`\n",
    "- __None__: Are written as `null`\n",
    "- __Array__: Are written as a list of values separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets (`[1, 2, 3]`)\n",
    "  - Can contain any data type\n",
    "  - Can be empty (`[]`)\n",
    "- __Object__: A set of properties separated by comas and with format key:value (`{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\"}`)\n",
    "  - Can contain any data type\n",
    "  - Can be empty (`{}`)\n",
    "  - No name restrictions\n",
