    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a great concept, one of the most important foundations of object-oriented programming that models a __tight relation between two classes__: the base class and the derived class, called a subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this relation is a subclass class that __inherits all methods and all properties__ of the base class, and allows a subclass to extend everything that has been inherited. By extending a base class, you are creating a more specialized class. Moreover, we say that these classes are __tightly coupled__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary use of inheritance is to __reuse the code__.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All classes derived from Vehicles own properties and methods responsible for informing the user of its mileage, starting and stopping the vehicle, fueling, etc. However, when you are reckless, then with the inheritance (especially multiple inheritances) you can create a huge, complex, and hierarchical structure of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance __is not the only way of constructing adaptable objects__. You can achieve similar goals by using a concept named __composition__.\n",

    "### Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is the process of composing an object using other different objects. The objects used in the composition deliver a set of desired traits (properties and/or methods) so we can say that they act like blocks used to build a more complicated structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- a Laptop has a network card;\n",
    "- a Hovercraft has a specific engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be said that:\n",
    "- __Inheritance:__ extends a class's capabilities by adding new components and modifying existing ones.\n",
    "- __Composition__ projects a class as a container able to store and use other objects where each of the objects implements a part of a desired class's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pluses and minuses of composition:\n",
    "- \\+ Higher flexibility\n",
    "- \\+ Not deep dependency investigations\n",
    "- \\- Transfers additional responsibilities to the developer (all component are used)\n",
