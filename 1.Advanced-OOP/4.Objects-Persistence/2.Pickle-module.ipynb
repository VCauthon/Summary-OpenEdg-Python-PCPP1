    "In this section, you will learn how to persist Python objects for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into detail about the subject matter, we will point out that: to transport an object converted into a pickle (we will get into this concept in no time), we need to __serialize__ and __deserialize__ the object. This process consists of converting a Python object into a stream of bytes. When the object is in this state, it can be transported between Python machines/scripts, but in order to use it, it will need to be deserialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last process consists of using the stream of bytes to reconstruct the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this understood, we can say that python has the pickle module to serialize its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the types that can be pickled:\n",
    "- None, booleans\n",
    "- Integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers\n",
    "- Strings, bytes, bytearrays\n",
    "- Tuples, lists, sets, and dictionaries containing pickleable objects\n",
    "- Objects, including objects with references to other objects (remember to avoid cycles!)\n",
    "- References to functions and classes, but not their definitions\n",
