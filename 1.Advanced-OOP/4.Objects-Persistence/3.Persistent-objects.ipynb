    "An important nuance that has been commented in serialization and deserialization of `pickles` is that, __when deserializing a pickle of several objects, the objects must be deserialized in the same order that they were serialized__. This can be a problem, since all the scripts that work with that pickle are forced to deserialize the whole objects and not to take only the object they are interested in using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this limitation there is the `shelve` library, __this library ends up being a usability layer that is above pickle__, so that it can facilitate its use. The addition that shelve includes is that it is a __database of objects__, that is to say, it allows to store as many objects as we want and then, as if it were a dictionary, to access the object that we need.\n",

    "### Tips for using the shelve modules\n",
    "\n",
    "When you treat a shelve object like a Python dictionary, you can make use of the dictionary utilities:\n",
    "- The `len()` function\n",
    "- The `in` operator\n",
    "- The `keys()` and `items()` methods\n",
    "- The `update` operation, which works the same as when applied to a Python `dictionary`\n",
    "- The `del` instruction, used to delete a key-value pair\n",
    "- Python puts the changes in a buffer which is periodically flushed to the disk. To enforce an immediate flush, call the `sync()` method on your shelve object\n",
    "- When you call the `close()` method on an shelve object, it also flushes the buffers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__IMPORTANT__: Because the shelve module is backed by pickle, it isn’t safe to load a shelve from an untrusted source. As with pickle, loading a shelve can execute arbitrary code."
