    "An important nuance that has been commented in serialization and deserialization of `pickles` is that, __when deserializing a pickle of several objects, the objects must be deserialized in the same order that they were serialized__. This can be a problem, since all the scripts that work with that pickle are forced to deserialize the whole objects and not to take only the object they are interested in using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this limitation there is the `shelve` library, __this library ends up being a usability layer that is above pickle__, so that it can facilitate its use. The addition that shelve includes is that it is a __database of objects__, that is to say, it allows to store as many objects as we want and then, as if it were a dictionary, to access the object that we need.\n",
