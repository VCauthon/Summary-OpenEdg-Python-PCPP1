    "    - Should not just simply repeat the function or method parameters.\n",
    "    - Do not use a blank line above or under a one-line docstring unless you're documenting a class.\n",
    "- Multiple lines:\n",
    "    - Should be used for non-obvious cases and more detailed descriptions of code segments.\n",
    "    - A multi-line docstring should be indented to the same level as the open quotes.\n",
    "    - You should insert a blank line after all the multi-line docstrings that are documenting a class.\n",
    "    - Should document the script's function, command line syntax, environment variables, and files.\n",
    "    - Module docstrings should list the classes, exceptions, and functions exported by the module.\n",
    "    - Package docstrings (understood as the docstring of the package's `__init__.py` module) should list the modules and subpackages exported by the package.\n",
