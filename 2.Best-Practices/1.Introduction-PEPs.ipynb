    "To read all the PEPs can be a titanic task, for that reason, the most remarkable editions are indicated below:\n",
    "- __PEP 1__: PEP Purpose and Guidelines, which provides information on the purpose of PEPs, their types and introduces general guidelines.\n",
    "- __PEP 8__: Python Code Style Guide, which gives conventions and presents best practices for coding in Python.\n",
    "- __PEP 20__: The Zen of Python, which presents a list of principles for Python design.\n",
    "- __PEP 257__: Docstring Conventions, which provides guidelines for the conventions and semantics associated with Python docstrings.\n",
