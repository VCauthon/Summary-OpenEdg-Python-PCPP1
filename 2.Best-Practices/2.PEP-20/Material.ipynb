    "From each of the verses a lesson can be drawn, at this point we will dissect each message into programming tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",
    "    - Make the code more readable > `79 characters maximum`.\n",
    "- Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
    "    - Avoid interpretation of the code by explicitly indicating that it will be used > `import concrete functionality and use of arguments` > `import concrete functionality and use of arguments`.\n",
    "- Simple is better than complex.\n",
    "    - Understand your tools to generate simple solutions > `Less lines of code`.\n",
    "- Complex is better than complicated.\n",
    "    - Better to generate one complex solution than several simple ones that turn into one complicated one > `Repetition of code is the evil` > `Repetition of code is the evil` > `Repetition of code is the evil` > `Simple is better than nested.\n",
    "- Flat is better than nested.\n",
    "    - Control the number of validations performed > `Not more than 3 if`.\n",
    "- Sparse is better than dense.\n",
    "    - Avoid concentrating too much code in one line > `If it can be read better make more lines`.\n",
    "- Readability counts.\n",
    "    - Code is read more often than it is written > `Let the declared elements have a meaning` > `Special cases aren't special enough to be read > `Special cases aren't special enough to be read\n",
    "- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\n",
    "    - Do not get carried away by the pressure of the moment and `respect standards and conventions`.\n",
    "- Although practicality beats purity.\n",
    "    - If the situation involves breaking some rule, break it (e.g., I want to make a sysout of a string that has 85 letters, but the standard only allows me 79, so yes, it is necessary to break that rule).\n",
    "- Errors should never pass silently.\n",
    "    - A program that crashes is easier to debug than a program that silences an error. > `don't use except Exception`\n",
    "- Unless explicitly silenced.\n",
    "    - there may be situations where you don’t want to shout “Hey! There’s an error!” > `just don't use Exception`\n",
    "- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\n",
    "    - what you assume to be the most common may turn out to be the least common > `explicitly tell what you need`\n",
    "- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\n",
    "    - everything has a clear purpose > `set the conventions with the team and each function has one clear responsibility`\n",
    "- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\n",
    "    - one obvious way to do something may not necessarily be obvious at first\n",
    "- Now is better than never.\n",
    "    - You should not put off till tomorrow what you can do today.\n",
    "- Although never is often better than *right* now.\n",
    "    - not to forget about the proper balance\n",
    "- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n",
    "    - f you find it difficult to explain its features and functionality, it may be a signal that maybe your idea should be thought over again and digested\n",
    "- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\n",

    "- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!\n",
