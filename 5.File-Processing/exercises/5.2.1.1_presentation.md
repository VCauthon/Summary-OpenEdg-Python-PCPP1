# Objectives
- Improving the student's skills in parsing configuration files;
- Improving the student's skills in creating configuration files.

# Scenario

Imagine a situation in which you receive a configuration file containing access data for various services. Unfortunately, the file is a terrible mess, because it contains data used in both production and development environments.

Your task will be to create two files named `prod_config.ini` and `dev_config.ini`. The `prod_config.ini` file should only contain sections for the production environment, while `dev_config.ini` should only contain sections for the development environment.

To distinguish between the environments, use the env option added to all sections in the [`mess.ini`](../persistance/mess.ini) file. The env option should be removed from the sections before moving them to the files.

# Expected result

The `prod_config.ini` file:


```INI
[sentry]
key = key
secret = secret

[github]
user = user
password = password
```

The `dev_config.ini` file:

```INI
[mariadb]
host = localhost
name = hello
user = user
password = password

[redis]
host = localhost
port = 6379
db = 0
```
