# Objectives
- Improving the student's skills in creating logs;
- Improving the student's skills in creating their own handler and formatter.

# Scenario
It's likely that the temperature of your phone battery can get pretty high. Check if that’s true. Write a program that will simulate the recording of battery temperatures with an interval of one minute. The simulation should contain 60 logs (the last hour).

To simulate temperatures, use one of the available random functions in Python. Temperatures should be drawn in the range of 
20–40 degrees Celsius, and then saved in the following format:

> LEVEL_NAME – TEMPERATURE_IN_CELSIUS_UNIT C

The drawn temperatures should be assigned to the appropriate level depending on their value:

> DEBUG = TEMPERATURE_IN_CELSIUS < 20<br>
> WARNING = TEMPERATURE_IN_CELSIUS >= 30 AND TEMPERATURE_IN_CELSIUS <= 35<br>
> CRITICAL = TEMPERATURE_IN_CELSIUS > 35<br>

Put all logs in the `battery_temperature.log` file. The task will be completed when you implement your own handler and formatter.
