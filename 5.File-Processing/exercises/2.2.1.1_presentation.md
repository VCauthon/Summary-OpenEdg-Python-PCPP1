# Scenario
Have you seen the weather forecast for the coming week? Itâ€™ll be an extremely sunny and warm week. Familiarize yourself with the data in the `forecast.xml` file and then complete the following tasks:

1. Create a class named `TemperatureConverter` and its `convert_celsius_to_fahrenheit` method. The `convert_celsius_to_fahrenheit` method should convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Use the following formula:
    <br>__F = 9/5 * C + 32__
2. Create a class named `ForecastXmlParser` and its `parse` method responsible for reading data from `forecast.xml`. Use the `TemperatureConverter` class to convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit (rounded to one decimal place). The `parse` method should print the following results:

- Monday: 28 Celsius, 82.4 Fahrenheit
- Tuesday: 27 Celsius, 80.6 Fahrenheit
- Wednesday: 28 Celsius, 82.4 Fahrenheit
- Thursday: 29 Celsius, 84.2 Fahrenheit
- Friday: 29 Celsius, 84.2 Fahrenheit
- Saturday: 32 Celsius, 89.6 Fahrenheit
- Sunday: 33 Celsius, 91.4 Fahrenheit
