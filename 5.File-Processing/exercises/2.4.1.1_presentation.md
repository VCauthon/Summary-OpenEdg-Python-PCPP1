You are a programmer working for an online store. Your task is to build an XML document containing information about the three vegan products available in the store:

```xml
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <shop>
        <category name="Vegan Products">
            <product name="Good Morning Sunshine">
                <type>cereals</type>
                <producer>OpenEDG Testing Service</producer>
                <price>9.90</price>
                <currency>USD</currency>
            </product>
            <product name="Spaghetti Veganietto">
                <type>pasta</type>
                <producer>Programmers Eat Pasta</producer>
                <price>15.49</price>
                <currency>EUR</currency>
            </product>
            <product name="Fantastic Almond Milk">
                <type>beverages</type>
                <producer>Drinks4Coders Inc.</producer>
                <price>19.75</price>
                <currency>USD</currency>
            </product>
        </category>
    </shop>
```

Save the document to the shop.xml file. Use UTF-8 character encoding and don't forget to add the prolog to the beginning of the file. Good luck!
