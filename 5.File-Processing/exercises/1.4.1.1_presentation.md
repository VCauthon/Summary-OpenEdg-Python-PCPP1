# Scenario

The application is almost ready. Let's add the missing functionalities to it:
1. Create a method called change_priority, responsible for updating task priority. The method should get the id of the task from the user and its new priority (greater than or equal to 1).
2. Create a method called delete_task, responsible for deleting single tasks. The method should get the task id from the user.
3. Implement a simple menu consisting of the following options:
    1. Show Tasks 
    2. Add Task 
    3. Change Priority 
    4. Delete Task
    5. Exit

Where:
- Show Tasks (calls the show_tasks method)
- Add Task (calls the add_task method)
- Change Priority (calls the change_priority method)
- Delete Task (calls the delete_task method)
- Exit (interrupts program execution)

The program should obtain one of these options from the user, and then call the appropriate method of the `TODO` object. Choosing option 5 must terminate the program. A menu should be displayed in an infinite loop so that the user can choose an option multiple times.
