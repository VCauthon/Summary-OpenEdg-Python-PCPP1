# Objectives
- Improving the student's skills in reading the CSV files;
- Using the reader function or the DictReader class.

# Scenario
When we buy a new phone, it's necessary to import old contacts. Why not import them from a CSV file?

Look again at the familiar [contacts.csv](../persistance/contacts.csv) file, and then design your new phone as follows:

- Create a class called `PhoneContact` representing a single contact.
    - The `PhoneContact` class should contain the name and phone properties;
- Create a class called `Phone` that will store your contacts. First, implement the method called `load_contacts_from_csv`, responsible for reading data from the CSV file into the class property called `contacts`.
    - The `contacts` property should contain a list of `PhoneContact` objects;
- Add to the `Phone` class a method called `search_contacts`, which accepts any phrase entered by the user from the keyboard, and then based on it perform a search for all matching `contacts` (case insensitive).
    - If there are no results, print the message: "No contacts found".

# Example 1

## Example input:

> Search contacts: mother

## Example output:

> mother (222-555-101)<br>
> mother-in-law (222-555-104)

# Example 2

## Example input:

> Search contacts: 103

## Example output:

> wife (222-555-103)
