    "Python has a system for logging everything that happens in the script. Do not confuse a log with the use of `print()`__ to terminally display an error that has been generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logs are used to detect when an error is occurring in the system at a point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "An __example of LOG__ would be the actions performed by a user on your web platform. A priori these logs would not be interesting, however, __if we detect a posteriori that on day X something strange happened in a user's account we will have the LOGS__ to be able to get an idea of what happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logs can be displayed in different formats:\n",
    "- A file\n",
    "- Output stream\n",
    "- Load them into an external system\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers all this functionality through the `logging` module.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Loggers\n",
    "\n",
    "The system with which Logs can be generated is called a logger and they work like classes in python, i.e. there is a hierarchy topped by a logger called `root`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then all its descendants inherit features from it, such as:\n",
    "- [Logging-levels](#logging-levels): How severe messages must be, as a minimum, to be processed.\n",
    "- [Handlers](#saving-logs): How messages will be displayed\n",
    "- [Format](#adding-format): The format in which the messages will be displayed.\n",
    "- Filters: Message filters can be applied so that they are not displayed by the current logger and children.\n",
    "- Propagation: Allow generated logs to propagate upwards (enabled by default)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the python script is simple, it is recommended to use the `root` logger. We can access it by creating the logger object through `getLogger()` without sending any parameters.\n",

    "Regarding the criticality inheritance, it is important to note that when creating a new logger (not root) it will have a `NOTSET` criticality level, however, instead of displaying all messages in a predefined way, it will inherit the criticality of its upper layer.\n",

    "\n",

    "- Logger B also inherits the `WARNING` level because both its level and that of its parent (Logger A) are `NOTSET`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we set the root logger to have a `NOTSET` criticality level, all its children will display all messages by default. Unless between the child and root there is a logger with a defined criticality level. Then that child will inherit that criticality level.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Saving logs\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned [above](#loggers), a logger can define where the generated logs will be stored, be it on the terminal, in a file or on an external system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To serve this purpose, `logging` introduces `Handlers`, in particular, and for saving logs to files, it introduces the `FileHandler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a handler to save logs to a file, do the following:\n",
    "1. Instantiate a `FileHandler`.\n",
    "2. When instantiating, the following arguments are provided:\n",
    "    - Name of the file\n",
    "    - Mode to work with (the same mode used in the `open()` function).\n",
    "3. On the instantiated handler we define the level at which these messages will be shown with the `setLevel` method.\n",
    "4. Bind the Handler in the Logger through the `addHandler` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: Note that each handler can have its own criticality level. This opens the door that, for the same logger, the critical messages are stored in a file and everything lower is only displayed on screen.\n",
