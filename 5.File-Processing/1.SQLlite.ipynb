    "## What SQLlite is made of\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLlite is one of the most popular databases in the world, in fact, it is a C library that allows users to read and write data directly to a file, since the database is still a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find SQLlite in multiple systems, for example, in the mobile phone itself to persist the data of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can say that this database does not need to work on a remote server to perform its functions, i.e., the client (who launches queries) and server (who stores the data) can be on the same computer, in addition, this has an installable so it does not require any additional configuration to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "But well, for our case we don't care about the installable part since Python has a module already integrated in it called `sqllite3` which provides an interface with DB-API 2.0 described in [PEP 249](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/).\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, with the following command line we could already use SQLlite in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `import sqlite3`\n",
    "\n",
    "> __NOTE__: This module is available in python from version 2.5 onwards.\n",
