    "## What SQLlite is made of\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLlite is one of the most popular databases in the world, in fact, it is a C library that allows users to read and write data directly to a file, since the database is still a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find SQLlite in multiple systems, for example, in the mobile phone itself to persist the data of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can say that this database does not need to work on a remote server to perform its functions, i.e., the client (who launches queries) and server (who stores the data) can be on the same computer, in addition, this has an installable so it does not require any additional configuration to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "But well, for our case we don't care about the installable part since Python has a module already integrated in it called `sqllite3` which provides an interface with DB-API 2.0 described in [PEP 249](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/).\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, with the following command line we could already use SQLlite in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `import sqlite3`\n",
    "\n",
    "> __NOTE__: This module is available in python from version 2.5 onwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a database\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have said before, SQLlite is a C library that allows to read and write over files, then, when working with `sqlite3` from python what we will end up doing is to interact with a file (which we can place in the directory that we prefer inside our project).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example bel we generate the connection against the database. In case this file does not exist it will be generated in the directory that we indicate."

    "\n",
    "You can also create a database in memory (`RAM`), i.e., the data stored in this database will persist until the system terminates the program or shuts down. To do this, the literal `:memory:` must be sent as an argument when instantiating the object with the database connection.\n",

    "\n",
    "SQL stans for __Structured Query Language__ and its used to create, modifying and managing relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might expect, `SQL` is not exclusive to `SQLlite`, but is used in relational databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. This language was created by IBM in the 1970s and, over the years, has been modified by different companies that used it in their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "This led to the need to generate a standard in order to establish a concrete syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the PEP, SQL has different standards, although it is important to note that __SQL-92__ is generally the most widely implemented, with some exceptions (which can be consulted in the following [link](https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html)).\n",

    "## Creating a TODO table\n",
    "\n",
    "As the title says, we are going to generate a database where we can store lists of tasks that we plan to do during the day, month or year. The structure of this database will consist of a single table called `tasks`, therefore, and in order not to generate extra files, we are going to reuse the database generated in the point of the guide [\"Creating a database\"](#creating-a-database).\n",
    "\n",
    "> As a reminder, this database was located in the path [./persistance/hello_world_bd.db](./persistance/hello_world_bd.db).\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the `tasks` table will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Table tasks](./media/table_tasks.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the tasks table\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the image shown above, we can say that the `tasks` table is made up of three columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically it would be:\n",
    "- `id`: Which would have the unique identifier per record.\n",
    "- name`: It corresponds to the task to be performed (a string)\n",
    "- `priority`: Consists of the priority set for the task (an integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate tables we must use the language mentioned above, i.e. `SQL`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure that this type of code would have is the following:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "        column1 datatype,\n",
    "        column2 datatype,\n",
    "        column3 datatype,\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        columnN datatype,\n",
    "    );\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> __NOTE__: All existing datatype's can be consulted in the following [page](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking into account the needs of the tasks table and the SQL structure to generate tables we should generate a SQL code similar to this one:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE tasks (\n",
    "    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n",
    "    priority INTEGER NOT NULL\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> __NOTE__: If you notice, both the `name` and `priority` variables take the `NOT NULL` arguments. This statement prevents the user from creating records in the table without defining the name of the task or its priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding rows into task table\n",
    "\n",
    "With the previous SQL statement we will be able to generate the tasks table, however, we still need to know how we can generate records in our table. For this we can use the `INSERT INTO` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow us to include records in the table we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL the statement to insert data into a table has the following format:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ..., columnN)\n",
    "VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ..., valueN);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the format we could generate the following statement:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "INSERT INTO tasks (name, priority) VALUES ('My first task', 1);\n",
    "\n",
    "// NOTE 1:\n",
    "// INSERT INTO tasks (id, name, priority) VALUES(0, 'My first task', 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "// NOTE 2:\n",
    "// INSERT INTO tasks VALUES('My first task', 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> __NOTE 1__: Columns that are primary key (as is the case of `id` in the `tasks` table) do not have to be reported in the statement that inserts data, since the table itself automatically reports an (incremental) value as a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE 2: In the INSERT INTO statement it is not mandatory to inform the columns where the data will be inserted. It can be interesting to indicate the columns if we will only partially store the data. For example, let's say that the priority is not a necessary data to indicate. Then we should do `INSERT INTO tasks (id, name) VALUES (0, 'My first task')`.\n",
