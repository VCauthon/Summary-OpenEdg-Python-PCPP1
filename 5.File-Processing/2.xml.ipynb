    "\n",
    "As we have seen in module 4 ([RESTful-APIs](../4.RESTful-APIs/Introduction.ipynb)), `XML` is a file format for storing and managing data. In Python, the standard library for managing data that is organised in `XML` format is called `xml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The most relevant modules of the xml library\n",
    "\n",
    "- `xml.etree.ElementTree`:\n",
    "    - Has a very simple API for analyzing and creating XML data.\n",
    "    - It's an excellent choice for people who have never worked with the Document Object Model (DOM) before.\n",
    "- `xml.dom.minidom`:\n",
    "    - Is the minimum implementation of the Document Object Model (DOM).\n",
    "    - Using the DOM, the approach to an XML document is slightly different, because it's parsed into a tree structure in which each node is an object.\n",
    "- `xml.sax`:\n",
    "    - SAX is an acronym for “Simple API for XML”.\n",
    "    - SAX is an interface in Python for event-driven XML document analysis.\n",
    "    - Unlike the above modules, analyzing a simple XML document using this module requires more work.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Segmenting an XML document\n",
    "\n",
    "XML is used by SOAP to transmit messages between systems. It is standardised by the W3C organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before segmenting it, an example of XML is shown:\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-2\"?>\n",
    "    <data>\n",
    "        <book title=\"The Little Prince\">\n",
    "            <author>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</author>\n",
    "            <year>1943</year>\n",
    "        </book>\n",
    "        <book title=\"Hamlet\">\n",
    "            <author>William Shakespeare</author>\n",
    "            <year>1603</year>\n",
    "        </book>\n",

    "```\n",

    "The elements that make up XML are the following:\n",
    "- __prolog__:\n",
    "    - The first (optional) line of the document. In the prolog, you can specify character encoding, e.g., `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-2\"?>` changes the default character encoding (UTF-8) to ISO-8859-2.\n",
    "- __root element__:\n",
    "    - The XML document must have one root element that contains all other elements. In the example below, the main element is the `data` tag.\n",
    "- __elements__: \n",
    "    - These consist of opening and closing tags. The elements include text, attributes, and other child elements. In the example below, we can find the book element with the `title` __attribute__ and two __child elements__ (`author` and `year`).\n",
    "- __attributes__:\n",
    "    - These are placed in the opening tags. They consist of key-value pairs, e.g., `title = \"The Little Prince\"`.\n",

    "The `ElementTree` module provides methods with which to transform the XML file.\n",

    "- `parse(path)`: Receives as argument the path to the XML file.\n",
    "    - Once the instance has been obtained, we must execute the `parse()` method on it to obtain the variable with which to work with the data.\n",
    "- `fromstring(str_xml)`: Receives as argument the XML file in STR format.\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing the transformation we will obtain an instance called `Element`. This instance is the one that allows us to browse through the whole file. It is important to note that the instance starts from the [root_element](#segmenting-an-xml-document), i.e. from the base of the XML tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigating the entire tree structure\n",
    "\n",
