    "\n",
    "The structure of these files is as follows:\n",

    "value1_H1, value1_H2\n",

    "\n",
    "### `reader`\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, `reader` reads the content of a csv file in a structured way, however, we must point out that this reading is not done directly from the file, but from an instance of `open` with which we have the data of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that, apart from the file itself, `reader` must receive the `delimiter` parameter indicating how the data will be separated within the CSV (although by default it is already set to `,`, but it could also be a `;`).\n",
