    "\n",
    "> NOTE: There are different databases that make use of this system and the popular data processing program EXCEL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of these files is as follows:\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "header1, header2\n",
    "value1_H1, value1_H2\n",

    "### `reader`\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, `reader` reads the content of a csv file in a structured way, however, we must point out that this reading is not done directly from the file, but from an instance of `open` with which we have the data of the file.\n",

    "Below is an example of reading the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### And the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "`reader` returns, in an iterator, the data organised in lists where each list represents a line of the CSV file itself, therefore, through a loop we could directly access them line by line.\n",
